# Note Taker

## Project Detials
To build a note taking app that allows one to keep track of notes and that can bee added to and delted for a person to keep track of things.

# Why
This was the first full stack app we have created it was not just a front end webpage. it utilizes that in what was prebuilt with the webpage and interactions but we had to build a back end data storage and interactions. It was to connect both front end and back end and then publish an app to heroku that let us utilize more than just client side storage.

# Problems Solved
connecting the front end and back end
deploying to herkou 
Having the data get entered and then added in the correct order
deletes on click

# Problems
This took a while for me I had to watch back the classes but found the miniproject very helpful.Most of my functions are alterations of the miniproject.
The only problem i couldnt resolve was deleting the individual code i ended up using .pop which removes all which isn't what I wanted but is better than no delete functionality.
I have left in some code to return to and update that I think oculd get the delte working if I had time to make more adjustments.

Update
I change the delte through splicing the data which seemed to work
